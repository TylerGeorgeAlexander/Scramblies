# Scramblies

Welcome to **Scramblies**, a fun and engaging word game designed to test your vocabulary and word-finding skills! Dive into a world of scrambled letters and see if you can unscramble them to form the correct words based on a randomly selected theme.

## Features

- **Randomly Selected Themes**: Each game session starts with a theme chosen randomly from a list including oceans, space, forests, music, and more.
- **Dynamic Letter Pool**: Players are presented with a pool of letters that can be used to form words related to the game's theme.
- **Interactive Letter Selection**: Click or tap on letters to add them to your guess, and submit to see if you've guessed a correct word.
- **Correct and Incorrect Guesses**: The game tracks and displays your successful and unsuccessful attempts separately.
- **Scramble Letters**: Stuck? Hit the scramble button to shuffle the letters in the pool for a new perspective.
- **Incremental Timer**: Keep an eye on the time with an incremental timer that tracks how long you've been solving the current set of scramblies.
