## QA Testing Feedback

- [ ] Theme and attempts guessed need different fonts, colors, and sizing.
- [ ] Avoid the use of pop-ups or modals for incorrect guesses. Build it into the UI (maybe at the bottom).
- [ ] Ensure the game is accessible for keyboard users. Currently, I can type words to guess but have to click the enter button to submit the guess.
- [ ] Add a display area for words that have been guessed.
- [ ] Highlight the letters as they are selected and provide a deselect option or continue using the trashcan.
- [ ] Swap the trashcan icon for a backspace icon.
- [ ] Implement a button to scramble the letters with no limit to the amount of scrambles. After all, it's called Scramblies.
- [ ] Ensure all letters can be selected.
- [ ] Standardize letter button sizes; some are chicklets, and some are corn. Pick one (probably chicklet).
- [ ] Add a timer to the game.
- [ ] The timer needs a pause feature.
- [ ] Include a date display since it will be a daily puzzle. Consider adding an archive for past puzzles.

### Positive Feedback
- [x] Cute design. Looks good. Nice and responsive.

Theme and attempts guessed need different fonts, colors, and sizing. Avoid the use of pop-ups or modals for incorrect guesses. Build it into the UI (maybe at the bottom).  I can type words in to guess, but I have to click the enter button to submit the guess, which makes this portion inaccessible for keyboard users. There's no place to show the words I've guessed. Maybe highlight the letters as they are selected. Have a deselect option, too, or continue using the trashcan. Swap the trashcan icon to a backspace icon There needs to be a button to scramble the letters (no limit to the amount of scrambles).  After all, it's called Scrambles. Why can't I scramble the letter? sob

There are letters I can't select.
Letters buttons are different sizes: some are chicklets, and some are corn. Pick one (probably chicklet).
There is no timer.

Timer needs a pause.
Need a date because it will be a daily puzzle. Maybe an archive.
